# Welcome to My First Python Project!

This is my first Python project, and I'm excited to share it with you! This project is a [rock-paper-scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) game implemented in Python.

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to start the game:
   ```shell
   python main.py
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose rock, paper, or scissors.
6. The computer will randomly choose its move.
7. The program will display the computer's choice and announce the winner or a tie.
8. After each game, you will be asked if you want to play again.
